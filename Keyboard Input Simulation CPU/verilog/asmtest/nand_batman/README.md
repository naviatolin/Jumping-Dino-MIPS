# Power of 2 Test

This test tests the CPU's ability of computing the nth power of 2. This is
helpful in testing the CPU's ability of handling loops as well as getting
around the CPU's inability of computing products.

This test uses three registers: $a0 to hold an n-value, $t0 to hold
computations, and $v0 to output the end result. The test does not require any
special setup procedures.
