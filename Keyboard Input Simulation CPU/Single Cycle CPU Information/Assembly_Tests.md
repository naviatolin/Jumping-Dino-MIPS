# How to Run the Assembly Tests
There are three assembly tests that encompass all of the possible instructions that this CPU can do.

- ALU
- Jumps_LW_SW
- BEQ_BNE

In order to run these, change the PROGRAM to be one of these three tests in the 'settings.mk' file.

Instructions for how to run the modules used to build the CPU are located in the verilog folder under the "Running_Module_Tests".
