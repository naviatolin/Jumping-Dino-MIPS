# What is this repository?
This is my final for the Computer Architecture course. It was broken into two seperate sections: creating a jumping dinosaur game in assembly, and exploring keyboard input in the MARS MIPS simulator on my own verilog CPU. 

# Where are these different components located?
All the information about the dinosaur game is located right here. For more information about the keyboard input simulation on the verilog CPU head over to the "Keyboard Input Simulation CPU" folder.
